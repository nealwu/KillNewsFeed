Kills the news feed and replaces it with a message reminding you not to get distracted. That's it. You can still check your messages and notifications, post status updates, and do everything you could do before. You just won't get distracting news feed posts anymore.

No more wasting time on Facebook. No more getting distracted when you log on to send a message. It's that simple.

**Updated on April 5, 2020 to support the new Facebook redesign and also to remove stories.
